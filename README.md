# News API NLP project
# General description
This project aims to use natural language processing to put in practice the topics learned in my studies. 
News API free version is used to get data from news about "artificial intelligence", since it's the free version there are 100 overviews of news with their URL and the source.
It is important to notice that this API is only free for development and Python is used as the coding language.
